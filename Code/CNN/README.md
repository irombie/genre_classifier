cnn.py is for constructing the network
feature.py is for preprocessing for feature extraction
mini.py is the code we run to see results
A toy dataset is provided in toy_data folder, just extract the archive and run
To run, you can use the Makefile: just type "make run". If you do not change the location of the toy dataset, it should work. 
Alternatively, you can just run by typing "python mini.py --dataset_folder_path=$(DATASET_PATH)" 
Due to spatial constraints, I could just provide you a very small portion of the dataset. The code does not give a meaningful output for that, but it shows that code is working. If you want to actually run the code, please email me (iremlergun@gmail.com) so that I can give you the whole dataset, which is larger than 7 GB.
